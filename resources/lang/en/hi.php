HI hostels maintain a certain level of quality and they are generally clean and safe.  And in many places in the world, especially smaller cities, the HI hostel is probably the only hostel in town. (By the way, Hostelz.com isn\'t affiliated with HI or any other group. We list HI hostels, hostels belonging to other hostelling groups, and independent hostels.)',
